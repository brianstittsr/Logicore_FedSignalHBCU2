**No Third Parties**: During the term of this Agreement, Client shall not engage any other third party for work related to the Application, except as otherwise agreed in writing by SVP. Client acknowledges that SVP is the sole source developer for the Application.

**Client Responsibility**: Client shall not attempt to circumvent, modify, or bypass SVP's development or maintenance processes for the Application. Client shall only request development work through the agreed channels with SVP.

## 4. DURATION

**Fee Adjustments**: SVP reserves the right to provide Client with {{fee_adjustment_notice_days}} days prior written notice of any potential adjustments to the Monthly Fee, based on changes to the agreed Scope of Work or other mutual agreements. Any adjustment shall be subject to Client's written approval.

**Late Payments**: Any payment not received within {{late_payment_grace_days}} business days of the due date may result in service suspension and may be subject to late fees, as determined by SVP.

## 6. IP OWNERSHIP

Upon full payment (or partial payment where specific deliverables are agreed upon separately), SVP shall transfer exclusive ownership of all work product, code, modifications, configurations, and documentation created by SVP specifically for Client under this Agreement to Client. Client shall own all rights, title, and interest in and to these deliverables. SVP retains the right to use its own name and logo for marketing purposes related to this engagement.

## 7. TERM AND TERMINATION

**Term**: This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue on a {{billing_period}} basis, renewable by mutual written agreement.

**Termination for Cause**: Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other Party materially breaches any provision and fails to cure such breach within {{termination_cure_days}} days of receiving notice of the breach.

**Termination by Client**: Client may terminate this Agreement for any reason by providing {{client_termination_notice_days}} days prior written notice to SVP.

**Termination by SVP**: SVP may terminate this Agreement for any reason by providing {{svp_termination_notice_days}} days prior written notice to Client.

SVP shall provide Client with a final deliverable or access to all IP transferred under this Agreement within {{termination_deliverable_days}} business days of termination. SVP shall continue to provide support for any pre-existing bugs or issues discovered within {{post_termination_support_days}} days after termination, unless otherwise agreed.

## 8. CONFIDENTIALITY

Both Parties agree to keep confidential all non-public information received from the other Party related to this Agreement or the Application. This obligation survives the termination of this Agreement for a period of {{confidentiality_duration_years}} years.

## 9. WARRANTIES

**SVP Warranties**: SVP warrants that it has the right and authority to perform the services under this Agreement and that it will not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third party in providing such services.

**Client Warranties**: Client warrants that it has the right to engage SVP and that it will not use the Application for illegal purposes.

## 10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

## 11. GOVERNING LAW

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State/Jurisdiction of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

## 12. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations, and agreements, whether oral or written.

## 13. AMENDMENTS
